h1. Steam

Steam is a headless integration testing tool driving "HtmlUnit":http://htmlunit.sourceforge.net to enable testing JavaScript-driven web sites. In that it is similar to "Culerity":http://github.com/langalex/culerity which drives "Celerity":http://github.com/jarib/celerity (which also drives "HtmlUnit":http://htmlunit.sourceforge.net). See below for a "comparsion":#comparsion.

<a name="installation"></a>

h2. Installation

Steam currently has the following dependencies:

* Working Java Runtime
* HtmlUnit (jar files)
* RJB and Locator gems

Installing Steam as as a gem will automatically install the required RJB and Locator gems:

pre. $ gem install steam

To install HtmlUnit you can download it from "Sourceforge":http://sourceforge.net/projects/htmlunit/files. 

You then need to add HtmlUnit to your Java classpath. The following ways should both work:

<pre># anywhere during startup, e.g. in features/support/env.rb
ENV['CLASSPATH'] = Dir["path/to/your/htmlunit/*.jar"].join(':')

# after steam has been added to the load path, e.g. in features/support/env.rb
Steam.config[:html_unit][:java_path] = 'path/to/your/htmlunit'</pre>

If you're on Mac OS X then you also need to export the JAVA_HOME variable for RJB. See here for two solutions: "Installing RJB on Mac OS X":http://www.elctech.com/articles/sudo-java_home-and-mac-os-x. The visudo way worked for us. Don't forget to add yourself to the sudoers file, though.


<a name="configuration"></a>

h2. Configuration

You should not need to configure anything. If you do need though have a look at "Steam.config":http://github.com/svenfuchs/steam/blob/master/lib/steam.rb

E.g. in order to tweak the Java load params you can

pre. Steam.config[:java_load_params] = "-Xmx2048M"


<a name="usage"></a>

h2. Usage

You can use Steam by itself as well as with Cucumber. You can find an example for a Cucumber setup in examples/cucumber/env.rb.

Steam is widely compatible with Webrat - many actions are implemented and take the same or very similar parameters as their Webrat equivalent. You even might be able to use the default webrat_steps.rb that ships with Cucumber, *but his file is meant as an example and might be out of date.*

h2. Comparsion to others

Steam's advantages over Culerity/Celerity:

* runs in Ruby MRI and does not require an entire JRuby environment.
* Steam can have the HtmlUnit browser running in the same stack as your tests, thus making the whole thing less complex and hard to debug
* Steam does not build on Celerity which is a quite heavy-weight Ruby wrapper around HtmlUnit adding a lot of unnecessary code
* Steam uses "Locator":http://github.com/svenfuchs/locator

Culerity/Celerity's advantages over Steam:

* RJB can't resolve the mismatch of Ruby vs Java threads which makes fancy setups impossible to solve
* Celerity implements a *lot* of stuff, maybe it contains something you need (e.g. maybe you want to test pop-down windows opening in the background?)
* Steam still is in its infancy

Kudos to "Alexander Lang":http://github.com/langalex for writing "Culerity":http://github.com/langalex/culerity which pioneered full-stack AJAX-enabled integration testing in Rails.
